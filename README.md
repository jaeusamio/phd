This is the code used for my PhD thesis.

**Chapter 1** contains the code for the processing of the crystal structures and the generation of the 3D plots showing bite angle, P-M distance, and buried volume.

**Chapter 3** contains the code for the generation of GJF files, extraction of descriptors from the DFT outputs, and generation of the PCA and subsequent techniques.

**Chapter 4** contains the code for the calculation of the coefficients for the DOE optimisation and the generation of the plots.

**Chapter 5** contains a simple script for the extraction of cone angles from xyz files.
